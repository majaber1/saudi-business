"""
Deterministic cash-flow projection derived from a study's recorded
assumptions. No AI, no invented numbers -- pure functions over whatever the
study's active StudyAssumption rows actually contain.

Recognizes a small set of canonical assumption keys mirroring the
feasibility model's known inputs (capex, revenue_year1, opex_annual,
growth_rate, discount_rate, horizon_years). A study must have at least
capex and revenue_year1 recorded as active assumptions before a projection
can be computed; nothing here estimates a value the study doesn't have.
Same assumption values always produce the same projection (see
app.api.feasibility: compute-from-assumptions persists which assumption
versions produced a given result, so it stays reproducible).
